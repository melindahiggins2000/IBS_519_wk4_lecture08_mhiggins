## Make a plot of Age (Y-axis) by Whole Weight (X-axis)

Let's make a 2 dimensional scatterplot of the abalone `age` by `wholeWeight`. We'll also overlay a best fit line by `sex.` And we'll add some better labels and title.

Notice that we can SEE the R code used here.

```{r}
ggplot(abalone_subset, aes(wholeWeight, age, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  xlab("Whole Weight in grams") +
  ylab("Age in years (rings + 1.5)") +
  labs(title = "Age of Abalones by Whole Weight",
       subtitle = "Best fit lines shown by sex") +
  labs(color = "Biological Sex")
```

## Inline r code to insert results inside a sentence

Here is an example of writing a sentence with some results that are automatically inserted. For example, the average age of the `r nrow(abalone)` abalones is `r mean(abalone$age)`.

## Making a simple table

Here is a simple table with a caption using the `table()` function and the `knitr::kable()` options for formatting.

```{r}
# a simple table
abalone_subset %>%
  select(sex) %>%
  table()
```

Now adding a caption 

```{r}
# a simple table
abalone_subset %>%
  select(sex) %>%
  table() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Biological Sex of Abalones - Counts")
```

Next add some custom column headings

```{r}
# a simple table
abalone_subset %>%
  select(sex) %>%
  table() %>%
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Biological Sex of Abalones - Counts",
    col.names = c("Biological Sex", "Frequency"))
```

## Very brief intro to `gtsummary` package

Another "tidyverse" compatible R package for working with tables is the `gtsummary` package.

Learn more at:

* [https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html)
* specifically review the vignette for the `tbl_summary()` function [https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)

The code below will produce a table with summary statistics based on the variable type:

* `sex` is categorical character variable so you get frequencies and percents of the total;
* `age` is continuous numeric variable so you get the median and IQR (interquartile range) by default.

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
abalone_subset %>%
  select(sex, age) %>%
  tbl_summary()
```

Suppose we instead want to get the mean and standard deviation for `age`. Inside the `tbl_summary()` function we can use the `statistic = list(...)` option.

```{r}
abalone_subset %>%
  select(sex, age) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})"))
```

We could take this a step further and get statistics by a grouping variable. For example, let's get the 3 dimensional measurements by `sex`. Inside the `tbl_summary()` function we can use the `by = group` option.

```{r}
abalone_subset %>%
  select(height, diameter, length, sex) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = sex,
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})")
    )
```

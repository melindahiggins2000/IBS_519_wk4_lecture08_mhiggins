# Header Level 1

Some text here.

## Header Level 2

More text here.

### Header Level 3

And we can have more text here.

## We can also do other text formatting

We can easily make a word or phrase show up in **bold letters** by starting and ending with 2 asterisks or __starting and ending with 2 underscores__.

We can also highlight some *words in italics* by starting and ending with a single underscore or starting _and ending with 1 asterisks_.

You can also make text show up in non-proportional type font like `Courier font` by starting and ending with a back tick (usually at the upper left of your keyboard). This is often used when noting an R package like `dplyr` or wanting the reader to notice some specific code like `summary(abalone$rings)`.

## Lists

We could add an unordered (no numbers) bulleted List - use either \* or - or +. To add a sub list, ALWAYS indent by 4 spaces

-   Item 1
-   Item 2
    -   add sub item 2.1
    -   add sub item 2.2
        -   add another sub sub item apples
        -   add another sub sub item oranges

You can also make an ordered list with numbers

1.  here is item 1 - with non-numbered sublist
    -   add item - socks
    -   add item - tie
    -   add item - hat
2.  here is item 2 - with "numbered"/"ordered" list - notice that even though there are multiple items beginning with "b." - the output properly orders these items as a. b. c. d. and so on...
    a.  apple
    a.  pear
    a.  banana
    a.  grapes
3.  here is another 3rd item

## Hyperlinks

You can easily add hyperlinks to any URLs (web links), by putting the words/phrase you want highlighted in []'s followed immediately by the "address" or URL of where you want the link to go in ()'s.

For example, here is the link to [Google](https://www.google.com).

Or a link to [You Tube](https://youtube.com).

## Link to an image

You can also easily add an image into your document - the syntax is very similar to a hyperlink.

This starts with a [] where you should type in some "alt text" to describe the image. Then put the filename with a path to the file if needed in the ().

Here is a little graphic of a sun.

Suppose you have your images in a subfolder, called images. There is a gray scale version in the "images" folder.

Here is a little graphic of a sun in gray scale.
